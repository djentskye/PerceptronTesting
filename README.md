# Perceptron Testing

## Overview

This project is an attempt at creating a functioning multilayer perceptron from scratch, in order to learn more about their inner workings. The current version of this project has support for single layer perceptrons, multilayer perceptrons, and various functions to manipulate said multilayer perceptrons. The backpropagation is fully functional, though remains to be optimized fully. An implementation of a neuroevolution simulation is currently in progress using these tools. Miscellaneous optimization and merging functions are currently in the works as well.
