# Perceptron Testing

## Overview

This project is an attempt at creating a functioning multilayer perceptron from scratch, in order to learn more about their inner workings. So far, basic functionality has been implemented, and I hope to continue refining the processes to increase the learning effectiveness of the MLP. Eventually I would like to start exploring various ways of using MLP's beyond basic functionality.
